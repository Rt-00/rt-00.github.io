# Why Publish?

I've lost count of how many times I've wanted to start publishing things — and given up.

Maybe because I thought no one would care, or that it would come off as "cheesy".
But after some reflection, I realized: if that's the mindset, we never take the first step toward anything.

So this time, I decided to go for it.

I'm not trying to be anyone's teacher.
I'm not here to impress, or go viral.

Honestly, I just want this to make sense for **me** — for my own studies, reflections, and learning process.
If, in the process, it ends up helping someone else, even better.

It’s like a personal backup — a snapshot of a moment in thought.

And maybe, just maybe, someone else will find it useful too.

So this is the beginning.
Just a place to publish what I find interesting.

Let’s see where it goes.
